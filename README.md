## 📖 What is it?

**BookBridge** is a powerful synchronization engine that bridges the gap between **Audiobookshelf** and **KOReader**. It ensures your reading and listening progress is always perfectly aligned, whether you're on your e-reader or listening on the go.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Five-Way Sync**: Syncs Audiobookshelf, KOReader, Storyteller, Grimmory, and Hardcover.
- **Multiple Readers**: Give each person their own sign-in, their own service logins, and their own progress — everyone sees only the books they are reading, even on a shared book.
- **Flexible Match Flows**: Link ABS or Grimmory audiobooks, or create ebook-only links when you only want text sync.
- **Flexible Setup**: You can intentionally turn Audiobookshelf off for ebook-only or maintenance-focused setups.
- **Dashboard Session Details**: See recent reading or listening session summaries right on the dashboard cards.
- **Smart Alignment Sources**: Uses Storyteller forced-alignment transcripts when available, then SMIL, then Whisper fallback.
- **Web UI**: Full management dashboard for tracking syncs and matching books.
- **Library Suggestions Page**: Scan your library for likely audiobook + ebook pairs, review them, and queue matches in bulk.
- **Guided Settings Workflow**: Check your service settings from the UI and save everything in one place.
- **Optional Bridge Sync Plugin Collections**: If you install the Bridge Sync KOReader plugin, Grimmory shelves can be used to shape KOReader collections.
- **Split-Port Security**: Expose only the sync API to the internet while keeping the dashboard on your LAN.
- **Self-Hosted**: Runs entirely in Docker on your own server.

> [!TIP]
> **Upgrading?** Review `docs/getting-started.md` to potentially simplify your `docker-compose.yml` volumes. The new Forge tool and CWA integration reduce the need for multiple volume mappings.

## Quick Start

```yaml
services:
  abs-kosync:
    container_name: abs_kosync
    image: ghcr.io/cporcellijr/bookbridge:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:5757"
      # - "5758:5758"  # Optional: expose the sync-only port when using KOSYNC_PORT=5758
    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - LOG_LEVEL=INFO
      # - KOSYNC_PORT=5758  # Optional: enable split-port mode
      # Configure ABS, KOSync, Grimmory, Storyteller, and other services in the Web UI.
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - /path/to/ebooks:/books
      # - /path/to/storyteller/library:/storyteller_library  # Optional: local Storyteller fallback/download access
      # - /path/to/storyteller/assets:/storyteller/assets    # Optional: Storyteller transcript ingest
```

Forge now uploads directly to Storyteller over the API, so a Storyteller library mount is no longer required for normal Forge ingestion.

If you want KOReader to download and manage bridge-provided books for you, an optional **Bridge Sync** KOReader plugin is available from the project's GitHub Releases page.

If you use that plugin, Grimmory shelf settings in the bridge can also shape the KOReader collections it creates.
