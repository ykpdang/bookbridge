# Release Notes - 7.2.0

The headline change is **reader-owned integrations, full BookFusion support, and a more reliable BridgeSync**. BookBridge now gives every reader a self-service place to manage their own service accounts, connects to BookFusion for progress, highlight, and book-upload sync, reorganizes Settings and Integrations around a clearer per-service layout, and makes large-library synchronization faster and more resilient.

Highlight and note sync still requires the **BridgeSync KOReader plugin from 7.1.0 or newer**. Standard KOReader/KOSync progress sync continues to work without it, but annotation exchange, sweep, close-capture, and managed collection features use the updated plugin. Install the latest bundled plugin (0.5.4) for the reliability improvements below. Devices that briefly installed BridgeSync 0.5.0 must reinstall manually because that disabled build cannot run its own updater.

## Added

- **Audiobook-only mappings** - Add / Update Book, the legacy Match page, and
  Batch Match can link an Audiobookshelf, Grimmory, or BookOrbit audiobook
  without an ebook. These mappings activate immediately, avoid EPUB/hash,
  transcript, and Forge work, and use percentage fallback when no locator EPUB
  exists.
- **BookFusion progress and highlight sync** - readers can link their own BookFusion account and sync reading progress with a real navigation anchor (chapter index, spine-normalized position, and CFI), so books reopen where they were left off. Highlights relay through the annotation hub using a fresh UTF-16 offset/xpointer mapper and a stable creation-time identity key, so BookFusion's own timestamp churn never gets mistaken for an edit or deletion on your other devices.
- **BookFusion book upload, including the Storyteller ReadAloud edition** - when BookFusion's search finds no match for a book with a local EPUB, the dashboard offers to upload it via BookFusion's Calibre upload API. Books linked to Storyteller can instead upload the full ReadAloud EPUB3 (SMIL media overlays plus narration audio) so BookFusion's own read-aloud feature has something to read. Upload failures report a specific reason, including when a file exceeds your BookFusion account's own upload size limit.
- **Self-service reader integrations** - each signed-in reader now has Account -> My Integrations, where they can manage service usernames, passwords, tokens, API keys, and per-user sync toggles. Admins can still manage those same fields for any reader from Settings -> Users.
- **Readest and Hardcover annotation spokes** - Readest cloud highlights and Hardcover annotations participate in the annotation hub using each reader's own account configuration; per-spoke version acknowledgments mean an annotation is only re-sent when its content actually changed, and edits made in Readest propagate back to your KOReader devices.
- **BridgeSync collections from Grimmory or Hardcover** - KOReader collection manifests can use either Grimmory shelves or Hardcover lists as the source, configured per reader.
- **Grimmory shelves to Hardcover lists** - readers can optionally mirror Grimmory shelf membership into Hardcover lists, with modes for all shelves, magic shelves, or regular shelves.
- **KoSync document reads warn on ambiguous user scope** - bulk KoSync document/state/book reads accept an optional user scope and log a warning when called without one, making it easier to spot an operation that could silently default to the wrong reader in a multi-user install.

## Changed

- **Settings and Integrations got a full reorganization** - every service now has one card, one name, and one position, identical between the admin Settings -> Integrations panel and each reader's Account -> My Integrations page, with a monogram badge, a one-line description, and a status pill (Configured / Not configured / Per-user accounts). The admin sidebar is now Integrations / Sync / Features / AI / System / Users / Logs; old settings bookmarks keep working.
- **Integration settings follow the reader** - user-owned credentials live with the reader, either in Account -> My Integrations or in the admin-managed user integrations page. Global Settings keep shared engine behavior such as server URLs, poll intervals, and daemon-level options.
- **KOReader collection controls are per-reader** - the collection source selector now lives under each reader's KOReader Collections integration group, making Hardcover-list collections discoverable even when Grimmory is disabled.
- **Connecting a KOReader device moved to My Account** - the sync-server address and the BridgeSync plugin download now live in a step-by-step "Connect a KOReader device" card on the Account page, instead of being buried in admin settings.
- **Docs got a clarity pass** - the site now leads with "what do you actually need?" and states plainly that Storyteller is optional (the bridge does its own audio/ebook alignment with built-in Whisper transcription); BookFusion uploads, the per-user KOSync login model, and StoryGraph are now documented.
- **BridgeSync handles large libraries and competing sync requests more reliably** - annotation and statistics uploads are bounded and acknowledgment-gated, paged results are drained completely, and overlapping work is serialized and coalesced. On-device status, safer payload handling, xpointer repair, semantic update checks, and translated interface strings make failures easier to diagnose and recover.
- **EPUB position resolution is substantially faster** - BookBridge shares cached book paths (bounded to a configured LRU size) between the parser and sync manager, bypasses unnecessary scans for managed cache files, and avoids parsing the same EPUB twice while resolving generated XPath positions. (#318)

## Fixed

- **Shelf-watch matching is now scoped per reader** - global and custom polling
  use each user's own library client and candidate pool, shared mappings are
  claimed through `UserBook`, and per-user BookOrbit ebook/audio IDs are stored
  in a link table so one reader's library identity cannot be used for another
  reader. (#318)
- **Manually selected KoSync hashes now stay selected** - previous and served-file hashes remain linked as siblings, so devices and progress resolve through either EPUB build without a manifest refresh replacing the chosen primary hash. (#316)
- **Mark Complete and audiobook completion are more reliable** - BookBridge filters clients by book type and support and records completion only after a successful remote update; Audiobookshelf's finished flag resolves progress to the book duration, Mark Complete persists service-native audio-position timestamps, and significance checks normalize every client to a percentage delta before applying thresholds. (#318)
- **Fresh external KoSync progress no longer loses zero-delta discrepancy resolution** - leader selection now retains an explicit recent external activity signal instead of rolling a device back to a stale service position when its ordinary delta happens to be zero.
- **Background work shuts down and resumes safely** - deleting a mapping cancels its transcription worker without allowing a late save to recreate it, while restart recovery serializes pending full Forge uploads. (#313, #314)
- **Routine incomplete or temporarily locked data no longer aborts maintenance work** - suggestion scans skip unusable Audiobookshelf duration records, and KOReader statistics writes retry ordinary SQLite lock contention. (#312, #315)
- **Audiobookshelf instant sync applies live debounce changes safely** - listener replacements no longer leak debounce workers, and self-write suppression remains active across longer debounce intervals.
- **Multi-user access checks tightened across several endpoints** - cover proxy endpoints verify book ownership before serving images, the Forge active-tasks API scopes non-admin callers to books they own, and admin-only diagnostic endpoints carry an explicit admin guard matching the existing before-request check.
- **BridgeSync 0.5.4 is more reliable under real device conditions** - managed paths on Kobo and Kindle storage tolerate case-only mount-directory differences, managed files count as deleted only after both the EPUB and its sidecar are removed, reading-session uploads are acknowledged and retried per session without inflating reading statistics on retry, and book deletion cleans up user membership rows explicitly.
- **Locator spine-position resolver and stabilization fixes from automated review** - synthetic inter-spine separators, trailing empty navigation/cover documents, CFI values that were off by over 100K characters, silent zero-error XPath failures, and un-round-trippable regenerated CFI are all resolved or rejected before reaching Grimmory or BookOrbit. See `docs/automated-review/BUG_REPORT.md` for the full defect analysis.

## Operational Notes

Database migrations apply automatically on startup. BookFusion support now covers progress, highlight, and book-upload sync, including the Storyteller ReadAloud edition. Web-reader annotation sync depends on the matching source credentials being configured for each reader. Restart BookBridge after updating, and install the latest bundled BridgeSync plugin on KOReader devices to receive the plugin-side reliability improvements.
