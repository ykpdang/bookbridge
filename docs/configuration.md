# Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> All configuration is managed through the **Web UI** at `/settings`.
> Environment variables are mainly for first boot or advanced overrides. Once a value is saved in the UI, the database value takes precedence.

## Web UI Settings

The **Settings** page is the easiest way to manage the bridge. Saving settings restarts the app automatically and sends you back to the dashboard when it is ready.

### Split-Port Security (Optional)

You can run the admin UI and the KOSync protocol on separate ports:

1. **Primary port (`8080`)**: Dashboard, Settings, logs, matcher, suggestions, and API routes.
2. **KOSync port**: KOSync routes only. This is the one you can expose to the internet.

To enable split-port mode, set `KOSYNC_PORT` and map the same port in Docker.

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:5757"
  - "5758:5758"
```

### Integrations

#### Audiobookshelf

Audiobookshelf remains the default audiobook source when a mapping is not explicitly using Grimmory audio.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | `ABS_SERVER` | empty | Required. |
| API Token | `ABS_KEY` | empty | Required. |
| Library ID | `ABS_LIBRARY_ID` | empty | Used by the matcher and search scoping. |
| Auto-add Collection | `ABS_COLLECTION_NAME` | `Synced with KOReader` | Collection used for matched audiobooks. |
| Progress Offset | `ABS_PROGRESS_OFFSET_SECONDS` | `0` | Rewinds progress written back to ABS by this many seconds. |
| Limit Search to Configured Library | `ABS_ONLY_SEARCH_IN_ABS_LIBRARY_ID` | `false` | In the UI this is a checkbox. Direct env usage can also be set to a library ID string. |

#### KOSync / KOReader

Use this when you want KOReader devices to sync directly with the bridge.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `KOSYNC_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on KOSync support. |
| Target KOSync URL | `KOSYNC_SERVER` | empty | External server URL, or the built-in bridge URL if you use the internal server. |
| Username | `KOSYNC_USER` | empty | KOReader username. |
| Password | `KOSYNC_KEY` | empty | KOReader password. |
| Hash Method | `KOSYNC_HASH_METHOD` | `content` | `content` is safest. `filename` is faster but less reliable. |
| Use Percentage from Server | `KOSYNC_USE_PERCENTAGE_FROM_SERVER` | `false` | Uses raw percentage instead of text matching. |
| Split-Port Listener | `KOSYNC_PORT` | empty | Optional dedicated KOSync port for internet-safe exposure. |

#### Storyteller

The bridge talks to Storyteller through the REST API only.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `STORYTELLER_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on Storyteller support. |
| API URL | `STORYTELLER_API_URL` | empty | Base URL for Storyteller. |
| Username | `STORYTELLER_USER` | empty | Storyteller username. |
| Password | `STORYTELLER_PASSWORD` | empty | Storyteller password. |
| Collection Name | `STORYTELLER_COLLECTION_NAME` | `Synced with KOReader` | Collection used when linked books are added to Storyteller. |
| Library Path | `STORYTELLER_LIBRARY_DIR` | `/storyteller_library` | Optional local Storyteller library path used for fallback/download helpers. Forge uploads go through the API. |
| Assets Path | `STORYTELLER_ASSETS_DIR` | empty | Root path that contains `/assets/{title}/transcriptions`. |
| Upload Chunk Size | `STORYTELLER_UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE` | `5242880` | TUS PATCH chunk size in bytes for direct Storyteller uploads. |
| Poll Mode | `STORYTELLER_POLL_MODE` | `global` | `global` uses the main sync cycle. `custom` polls Storyteller separately. |
| Poll Interval | `STORYTELLER_POLL_SECONDS` | `45` | Used when Poll Mode is `custom`. |

Storyteller notes:

- Forge imports use the Storyteller REST/TUS API directly. A Storyteller library mount is optional unless you want local fallback access to generated artifacts.
- If you mount `/path/to/storyteller/assets:/storyteller/assets`, set **Storyteller Assets Path** to `/storyteller`.
- Storyteller timing data stays the preferred alignment source whenever valid transcript assets are available.
- **Settings -> Storyteller Backfill** rechecks existing Storyteller-linked books and rebuilds their alignment data without rerunning Whisper.

#### Grimmory

Grimmory now supports both ebook sync and Grimmory audiobook-backed mappings.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `BOOKLORE_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on Grimmory support. |

| Password | `BOOKLORE_PASSWORD` | empty | Grimmory password. |
| Shelf Name | `BOOKLORE_SHELF_NAME` | `Kobo` | Shelf used for matched ebooks. |
| Library ID | `BOOKLORE_LIBRARY_ID` | empty | Optional library restriction. |
| Poll Mode | `BOOKLORE_POLL_MODE` | `global` | `global` uses the main sync cycle. `custom` polls Grimmory separately. |
| Poll Interval | `BOOKLORE_POLL_SECONDS` | `300` | Used when Poll Mode is `custom`. |

Grimmory notes:

- Match, Batch Match, Suggestions, and Forge can now use **Grimmory audiobooks** as the audio source.
- The dashboard shows **BL Audio** progress when a mapping is driven by Grimmory audio.
- **Settings -> Refresh Grimmory Cache** forces a fresh cache rebuild after imports, removals, or large metadata changes.

Advanced Grimmory cache tuning:

#### Shelfmark

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Enable Suggestions | `SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED` | `false` | Enables the Suggestions page and background suggestion discovery. |

Suggestions notes:

## GPU Support (Optional)

For faster local transcription, you can give the container access to an NVIDIA GPU.

### 1. Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit

Follow the official guide for the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).

### 2. Update Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  abs-kosync:
    # ... other config ...
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

### 3. Configure the bridge

In **Settings**:

1. Set **Transcription Provider** to `local`.
2. Set **Whisper Device** to `cuda`.
3. Set **Whisper Compute Type** to `float16`.
4. Use a larger model such as `small` or `medium` if your GPU can handle it.
