# Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> All configuration is managed through the **Web UI** at `/settings`.
> Environment variables are mainly for first boot or advanced overrides. Once a value is saved in the UI, the database value takes precedence.

## Web UI Settings

The **Settings** page is the easiest way to manage the bridge. Each service section includes a **Test** button so you can check a service before saving. Saving settings restarts the app automatically and brings you back to the dashboard when it is ready.

### Split-Port Security (Optional)

You can run the admin UI and the KOSync protocol on separate ports:

1. **Primary port (`8080`)**: Dashboard, Settings, logs, matcher, suggestions, and API routes.
2. **KOSync port**: KOSync routes only. This is the one you can expose to the internet.

To enable split-port mode, set `KOSYNC_PORT` and map the same port in Docker.

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:5757"
  - "5758:5758"
```

### Integrations

#### Audiobookshelf

Audiobookshelf remains the default audiobook source when a mapping is not explicitly using Grimmory audio.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Server URL | `ABS_SERVER` | empty | Required. |
| API Token | `ABS_KEY` | empty | Required. |
| Library ID | `ABS_LIBRARY_ID` | empty | Used by the matcher and search scoping. |
| Auto-add Collection | `ABS_COLLECTION_NAME` | `Synced with KOReader` | Collection used for matched audiobooks. |
| Progress Offset | `ABS_PROGRESS_OFFSET_SECONDS` | `0` | Rewinds progress written back to ABS by this many seconds. |
| Limit Search to Configured Library | `ABS_ONLY_SEARCH_IN_ABS_LIBRARY_ID` | `false` | In the UI this is a checkbox. Direct env usage can also be set to a library ID string. |

Audiobookshelf notes:

- Use **Find IDs** next to **Library ID** in Settings to load your available ABS libraries and fill the field from a dropdown.
- If you want to run without Audiobookshelf for a while, enter `disabled` in the ABS URL or token field to intentionally turn ABS off.

#### KOSync / KOReader

Use this when you want KOReader devices to sync directly with the bridge.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `KOSYNC_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on KOSync support. |
| Target KOSync URL | `KOSYNC_SERVER` | empty | External server URL, or the built-in bridge URL if you use the internal server. |
| Username | `KOSYNC_USER` | empty | KOReader username. |
| Password | `KOSYNC_KEY` | empty | KOReader password. |
| Hash Method | `KOSYNC_HASH_METHOD` | `content` | `content` is safest. `filename` is faster but less reliable. |
| Use Percentage from Server | `KOSYNC_USE_PERCENTAGE_FROM_SERVER` | `false` | Uses raw percentage instead of text matching. |
| Split-Port Listener | `KOSYNC_PORT` | empty | Optional dedicated KOSync port for internet-safe exposure. |

KOSync notes:

- If you use the built-in KOSync bridge, the **Test** button checks the values currently typed into the form before you save them.

#### Storyteller

The bridge talks to Storyteller through the REST API only.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `STORYTELLER_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on Storyteller support. |
| API URL | `STORYTELLER_API_URL` | empty | Base URL for Storyteller. |
| Username | `STORYTELLER_USER` | empty | Storyteller username. |
| Password | `STORYTELLER_PASSWORD` | empty | Storyteller password. |
| Collection Name | `STORYTELLER_COLLECTION_NAME` | `Synced with KOReader` | Collection used when linked books are added to Storyteller. |
| Library Path | `STORYTELLER_LIBRARY_DIR` | `/storyteller_library` | Optional local Storyteller library path used for fallback/download helpers. Forge uploads go through the API. |
| Assets Path | `STORYTELLER_ASSETS_DIR` | empty | Root path that contains `/assets/{title}/transcriptions`. |
| Upload Chunk Size | `STORYTELLER_UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE` | `5242880` | TUS PATCH chunk size in bytes for direct Storyteller uploads. |
| Poll Mode | `STORYTELLER_POLL_MODE` | `global` | `global` uses the main sync cycle. `custom` polls Storyteller separately. |
| Poll Interval | `STORYTELLER_POLL_SECONDS` | `45` | Used when Poll Mode is `custom`. |

Storyteller notes:

- Forge imports use the Storyteller REST/TUS API directly. A Storyteller library mount is optional unless you want local fallback access to generated artifacts.
- If you mount `/path/to/storyteller/assets:/storyteller/assets`, set **Storyteller Assets Path** to `/storyteller`.
- Storyteller timing data stays the preferred alignment source whenever valid transcript assets are available.
- **Settings -> Storyteller Backfill** rechecks existing Storyteller-linked books and rebuilds their alignment data without rerunning Whisper.

#### Grimmory

Grimmory now supports both ebook sync and Grimmory audiobook-backed mappings.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `BOOKLORE_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on Grimmory support. |
| Server URL | `BOOKLORE_SERVER` | empty | Grimmory base URL. |
| Username | `BOOKLORE_USER` | empty | Grimmory username. |
| Password | `BOOKLORE_PASSWORD` | empty | Grimmory password. |
| Shelf Name | `BOOKLORE_SHELF_NAME` | `Kobo` | Shelf used for matched ebooks. |
| Library ID | `BOOKLORE_LIBRARY_ID` | empty | Optional library restriction. |
| Record Reading Sessions | `GRIMMORY_READING_SESSIONS` | `true` | Sends reading or listening session updates back to Grimmory. |
| Collection Syncing | `DEVICE_SYNC_COLLECTIONS` | `off` | Optional Bridge Sync plugin feature for turning Grimmory shelves into KOReader collections. |
| Excluded Shelves | `DEVICE_SYNC_EXCLUDED_SHELVES` | empty | Optional Bridge Sync plugin setting for shelves that should be skipped. |
| Poll Mode | `BOOKLORE_POLL_MODE` | `global` | `global` uses the main sync cycle. `custom` polls Grimmory separately. |
| Poll Interval | `BOOKLORE_POLL_SECONDS` | `300` | Used when Poll Mode is `custom`. |

Grimmory notes:

- Match, Batch Match, Suggestions, and Forge can now use **Grimmory audiobooks** as the audio source.
- The dashboard shows **BL Audio** progress when a mapping is driven by Grimmory audio.
- When **Record Reading Sessions** is enabled, Grimmory gets session updates as you make progress.
- **Settings -> Refresh Grimmory Cache** forces a fresh cache rebuild after imports, removals, or large metadata changes.
- Use **Find IDs** next to **Library ID** in Settings to load your available Grimmory libraries and fill the field from a dropdown.
- The **Device Sync Collections** settings only matter if you use the optional **Bridge Sync** KOReader plugin.
- **Collection Syncing** controls whether Bridge Sync should turn Grimmory shelves into KOReader collections.
- **Magic Shelves Only** means Bridge Sync uses shelves in Grimmory that fill themselves based on rules.
- **Excluded Shelves** lets you list shelf names you do not want turned into KOReader collections.
- **Find Shelves** helps you pick shelf names from Grimmory instead of typing them by hand.

Advanced Grimmory cache tuning:

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Max Detail Fetches per Refresh | `BOOKLORE_MAX_DETAIL_FETCHES_PER_REFRESH_CYCLE` | `1200` | Caps how many detailed records a refresh can hydrate in one pass. |
| Search Hit Refresh Min Age | `BOOKLORE_SEARCH_HIT_REFRESH_MIN_AGE` | `1800` | Minimum cache age before a successful search can trigger a quick validation refresh. |
| Search Hit Refresh Cooldown | `BOOKLORE_SEARCH_HIT_REFRESH_COOLDOWN` | `600` | Cooldown between quick validation refreshes after search hits. |
| Login Retry Delay | `BOOKLORE_LOGIN_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS` | `1.1` | Delay before retrying duplicate refresh-token login conflicts. |
| Login Max Attempts | `BOOKLORE_LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `2` | Maximum login attempts before failing. |

#### BookOrbit

BookOrbit is a newer ebook library manager (with audiobook support, like Grimmory). The bridge treats it as an alternative to Grimmory — you can use either one or both at the same time.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `BOOKORBIT_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on BookOrbit support. |
| Server URL | `BOOKORBIT_SERVER` | empty | BookOrbit base URL. |
| Username | `BOOKORBIT_USER` | empty | BookOrbit username. |
| Password | `BOOKORBIT_PASSWORD` | empty | BookOrbit password. |
| Collection Name | `BOOKORBIT_SHELF_NAME` | `Kobo` | Collection that auto-matched books are moved to on success. |
| Record Reading Sessions | `BOOKORBIT_READING_SESSIONS` | `true` | Sends reading or listening session updates back to BookOrbit. |
| Poll Mode | `BOOKORBIT_POLL_MODE` | `global` | `global` uses the main sync cycle. `custom` polls BookOrbit separately. |
| Poll Interval | `BOOKORBIT_POLL_SECONDS` | `300` | Used when Poll Mode is `custom`. |

Optional "Up Next" collection watch — drop a book onto a collection in BookOrbit and the bridge auto-matches it on the next poll:

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Watch a Collection | `BOOKORBIT_SHELF_WATCH_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on auto-matching from a watched collection. |
| Collection Name | `BOOKORBIT_SHELF_WATCH_NAME` | `Up Next` | Create this collection in BookOrbit. Books placed on it are auto-matched and moved to the collection above on success. |
| Match Threshold | `BOOKORBIT_SHELF_WATCH_THRESHOLD` | `95` | Minimum match confidence (60–100) before a book is auto-linked. |
| Rescan Interval (Hours) | `BOOKORBIT_SHELF_WATCH_RESCAN_HOURS` | `24` | How often a still-unmatched book on the watch collection is retried. |

BookOrbit notes:

- BookOrbit works like Grimmory across Match, Batch Match, Suggestions, and the dashboard — pick it as the ebook (or audio) source when you create a mapping.
- Use the **Test** button in Settings to check the connection before saving.
- **Moving from Grimmory to BookOrbit?** You do not need to rematch. A helper script, `scripts/migrate_grimmory_to_bookorbit.py`, re-points your existing Grimmory ebook links at BookOrbit by filename, leaving the audio link and reading progress untouched. Enable and scan BookOrbit first, then run it from inside the container (it is a dry run by default; add `--apply` to commit):

    ```bash
    docker exec abs_kosync python -m scripts.migrate_grimmory_to_bookorbit --apply
    ```

#### Calibre-Web Automated (CWA)

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `CWA_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on OPDS / CWA ebook search and download. |
| Server URL | `CWA_SERVER` | empty | CWA base URL. |
| Username | `CWA_USERNAME` | empty | Optional username. |
| Password | `CWA_PASSWORD` | empty | Optional password. |

#### Hardcover.app

Hardcover provides modern reading tracking with a beautiful UI.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `HARDCOVER_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on Hardcover updates. |
| API Token | `HARDCOVER_TOKEN` | empty | Personal API token from Hardcover. |

Hardcover notes:

- When enabled, progress is synced from KOReader/Audiobookshelf to Hardcover.
- Use the **Edition Picker** on the dashboard to select which specific edition to track.

#### StoryGraph

StoryGraph is a popular alternative to Goodreads that focuses on reading data and moods.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `STORYGRAPH_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on StoryGraph updates. |
| Session Cookie | `STORYGRAPH_SESSION_COOKIE` | empty | `_storygraph_session` cookie value. |
| Remember User Token | `STORYGRAPH_REMEMBER_USER_TOKEN` | empty | `remember_user_token` cookie value. |

StoryGraph notes:

- Requires browser cookies for authentication. See the [User Guide](user-guide.md#storygraph-authentication) for instructions on how to retrieve these.
- Supports **Edition Picking**: Select specific editions (Paperback, Kindle, etc.) to ensure accurate page counts.
- **Switch Editions**: The bridge can automatically "switch" your tracked edition on StoryGraph to match your selection.

#### Progress Trackers

Hardcover and StoryGraph are independent — enable either or both with their `*_ENABLED`
toggles in Settings → Trackers. Each user then picks which they use, and supplies their own
token/cookies, under Settings → Users → (user) → Integrations.

#### Telegram Notifications

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `TELEGRAM_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns on Telegram notifications. |
| Bot Token | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | empty | BotFather token. |
| Chat ID | `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | empty | Target user or group ID. |
| Min Log Level | `TELEGRAM_LOG_LEVEL` | `ERROR` | Lowest log severity that gets forwarded. |

#### Shelfmark

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shelfmark URL | `SHELFMARK_URL` | empty | Adds the Shelfmark shortcut when configured. |

#### Ollama (Local LLM, Optional)

This is an advanced, opt-in feature. If you run a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server, the bridge can use it to make smarter book-match suggestions and to rescue audio↔text alignments that plain text matching misses. Everything here is **off until you enable it**, and every feature falls back to the normal behavior if Ollama is unreachable — so it never blocks a sync.

Connection:

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable | `OLLAMA_ENABLED` | `false` | Master switch for all Ollama features. |
| Server URL | `OLLAMA_URL` | `http://ollama:11434` | Your Ollama server. Use container DNS (`http://ollama:11434`) or `http://localhost:11434`. |
| Embedding Model | `OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL` | `nomic-embed-text` | Used for similarity. Pull it first: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`. |
| Chat / Judge Model | `OLLAMA_CHAT_MODEL` | `qwen2.5:14b` | Used to judge ambiguous matches. |
| Keep Alive | `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` | `5m` | How long models stay loaded after a request (`5m`, `1h`, `-1` = forever, `0` = unload now). |
| Chat Context Length | `OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` | empty | Context window for judge calls. Empty = server default. |

What it can do — each is a separate toggle, and the defaults below only take effect once **Enable** is on:

| Feature | Env Var | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Re-rank suggestions | `OLLAMA_RERANK_SUGGESTIONS` | `true` | Re-scores borderline suggestions by meaning, not just fuzzy text. |
| Suppress weak suggestions | `OLLAMA_SUGGEST_JUDGE_GATE` | `true` | Drops candidates the model can't confirm as a real match. |
| Judge ambiguous matches | `OLLAMA_JUDGE_SUGGESTIONS` | `true` | Asks the chat model to resolve close calls. |
| Alignment fallback | `OLLAMA_ALIGN_FALLBACK` | `true` | Locates a position by meaning when fuzzy text matching fails. |
| Ebook position rescue | `OLLAMA_EBOOK_TEXT_FALLBACK` | `true` | The same idea for KoSync/Storyteller ebook lookups. |
| Anchor rescue | `OLLAMA_ALIGN_ANCHOR_RESCUE` | `true` | Builds a real audio↔text map when n-gram alignment fails. |
| Content guard | `OLLAMA_ALIGN_CONTENT_GUARD` | `true` | Refuses to store an alignment when the audio and ebook are clearly different content (wrong edition, abridged, translation). |
| Tracker match verify | `OLLAMA_TRACKER_MATCH` | `true` | Double-checks Hardcover/StoryGraph matches before writing. |
| Library match rescue | `OLLAMA_LIBRARY_MATCH` | `true` | When a Grimmory/BookOrbit ebook won't match by name, shortlists the library and lets the model pick the right book. |

Ollama notes:

- The model never runs on hot sync paths — only on linking, suggestion scans, and alignment work — so day-to-day syncing stays fast.
- Use the **Test** button to confirm the server is reachable. It reports each model's context length and capabilities, and warns if your embedding model can't actually embed.
- Finer tuning knobs (score bands, judge margins, similarity thresholds) are available in the Settings UI if you want them, but the defaults are a sensible starting point.

### Suggestions

The Suggestions page is a review workspace, not an auto-linker. It always waits for your approval before creating mappings.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable Suggestions | `SUGGESTIONS_ENABLED` | `false` | Enables the Suggestions page and background suggestion discovery. |

Suggestions notes:

- A normal scan reuses cached results so repeat scans are faster.
- **Full Refresh** rescans the whole unmatched library from scratch.
- Suggestions can queue ABS-backed links, Grimmory-audio links, ebook-only links, and Storyteller-only links.

### Transcription Settings

> [!TIP]
> Storyteller transcript assets are preferred over SMIL and Whisper whenever they are available and valid.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Provider | `TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` | `local` | `local`, `deepgram`, or `whispercpp`. |
| Whisper Model | `WHISPER_MODEL` | `tiny` | Local Whisper model size or a custom Whisper.cpp model name. |
| Whisper Device | `WHISPER_DEVICE` | `auto` | `auto`, `cpu`, or `cuda`. |
| Whisper Compute Type | `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` | `auto` | Precision mode for local Whisper. |
| Whisper.cpp URL | `WHISPER_CPP_URL` | empty | URL to your Whisper.cpp HTTP endpoint. |
| Deepgram API Key | `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | empty | Deepgram API key. |
| Deepgram Model | `DEEPGRAM_MODEL` | `nova-2` | Deepgram model tier. |
| SMIL Validation Threshold | `SMIL_VALIDATION_THRESHOLD` | `60` | Minimum token match percentage for accepting SMIL timing data. |

Transcription notes:

- The **Whisper Model** field in Settings is a text box with common suggestions. You can use a normal preset like `tiny` or enter a custom model name directly.

| Cross-Format Deadband (Seconds) | `CROSSFORMAT_DEADBAND_SECONDS` | `2.0` | Prevents tiny cross-format gaps from causing leader flips while avoiding backward writes to newer high-confidence ebook locators. |
| Cross-Format Roundtrip Tolerance | `CROSSFORMAT_ROUNDTRIP_TOLERANCE_CHARS` | `2` | Locator roundtrip tolerance used when stabilizing cross-format locators. |

### Advanced Toggles

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sync ABS Ebook | `SYNC_ABS_EBOOK` | `false` | Also syncs to the ABS ebook item when present. |
| XPath Fallback | `XPATH_FALLBACK_TO_PREVIOUS_SEGMENT` | `false` | Tries the previous segment if a locator lookup fails. |
| Reprocess on Clear | `REPROCESS_ON_CLEAR_IF_NO_ALIGNMENT` | `true` | Rebuilds missing data after resetting progress when needed. |

| Storyteller Upload Chunk Size | `STORYTELLER_UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE` | `5242880` | TUS upload chunk size in bytes for direct Storyteller uploads. |
| Ebook Cache Size | `EBOOK_CACHE_SIZE` | `3` | Parsed-ebook cache size. |

---

## GPU Support (Optional)

For faster local transcription, you can give the container access to an NVIDIA GPU.

### 1. Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit

Follow the official guide for the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html).

### 2. Update Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  abs-kosync:
    # ... other config ...
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```

### 3. Configure the bridge

In **Settings**:

1. Set **Transcription Provider** to `local`.
2. Set **Whisper Device** to `cuda`.
3. Set **Whisper Compute Type** to `float16`.
4. Use a larger model such as `small` or `medium` if your GPU can handle it.
