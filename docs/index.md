## What is it?

**BookBridge** is a self-hosted sync engine for audiobooks and ebooks. It keeps your reading and listening position aligned across multiple apps, whether the source is Audiobookshelf, KOReader, Grimmory, BookOrbit, Calibre-Web Automated, or Storyteller. With the current Bridge Sync KOReader plugin, it can also move highlights and notes between supported readers.

### Supported Services

| Platform | Type | Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Audiobookshelf** | Audiobooks + optional ebooks | Audiobook progress sync, optional ebook progress, library matching |
| **KOReader / KOSync** | Ebooks | Reading progress sync; highlights/notes through the current Bridge Sync plugin |
| **Storyteller** | Read-along reader | Progress sync and alignment source for read-along books |
| **Grimmory** | Ebooks + audiobooks | Ebook progress, audiobook-source sync, reading sessions, optional annotation relay |
| **BookOrbit** | Ebooks + audiobooks | Ebook progress, audiobook-source sync, reading sessions, optional highlight relay |
| **Calibre-Web Automated (CWA)** | Ebooks + Kobo-protocol sync | Ebook source/search/download; optional progress sync through CWA's Kobo sync protocol, used by stock Kobo readers and KOReader-via-CWA |
| **Hardcover.app** | Reading tracker | Write-only tracking |

!!! note "Highlights and notes"
    Annotation sync requires the Bridge Sync KOReader plugin from the current release or newer. Plain KOReader/KOSync clients continue syncing position, but they do not sync highlights or notes.

## Features

### Core Sync Engine

- **Multi-service sync** across the supported progress paths for Audiobookshelf, KOReader, Storyteller, Grimmory, BookOrbit, CWA/Kobo sync, and reading trackers.
- **Flexible source support**: use Audiobookshelf, Grimmory, or BookOrbit as the audio source; use Audiobookshelf ebooks, Grimmory, BookOrbit, CWA, or local files as the text source; or create ebook-only links when no audiobook is needed.
- **Split-port security** so the KOSync endpoint can be exposed separately from the dashboard.
- **Smart conflict handling** with anti-regression guardrails and a deadband to avoid tiny cross-format bounce-backs.
- **Highlight and note sync** for KOReader devices using the current Bridge Sync plugin, with optional Grimmory and BookOrbit web-reader relay.
- **Rich locators** using timestamps, href/fragment data, XPath, and EPUB CFI where available.
- **Storyteller-first alignment** when valid Storyteller transcript assets exist, followed by SMIL and Whisper fallback.
- **Resumable jobs** for background processing and transcript work.

### Management Web UI

- **Multiple readers** with their own sign-in, their own service logins, and their own progress — each person sees only the books they are reading.
- **Dashboard** for live sync status, reading session details, direct service links, and source badges.
- **Add / Update Book** for ABS, Grimmory, or BookOrbit audio; CWA, Grimmory, BookOrbit, ABS, or local ebook sources; Storyteller links; ebook-only flows; and reader document fixes.
- **Batch Match** for queue-based review and bulk linking.
- **Library Suggestions** for background scanning, review, and queue building.
- **Forge** for Storyteller read-along preparation.
- **Dynamic Settings** with live connection tests and automatic restart after saving.
- **Flexible setup** including an intentional Audiobookshelf-off mode for ebook-only or maintenance-focused use.
- **Optional Bridge Sync plugin support** for turning Grimmory shelves into KOReader collections, syncing reading stats, and syncing highlights/notes.

### Automation and Reliability

- **Background daemon** with configurable polling.
- **Instant sync** from ABS playback events and KOReader pushes when enabled.
- **Per-client polling** for Storyteller, Grimmory, BookOrbit, and CWA/Kobo sync.
- **Library refresh and backfill tools** for connected ebook/audio sources and Storyteller alignment data.
- **Optional local-LLM assist (Ollama)** for smarter match suggestions and alignment rescue — off by default.

## How It Works

1. **Triggers**: the bridge reacts to ABS playback events, KOReader pushes, or scheduled polling.
2. **Normalization**: timestamps, percentages, CFI, and Storyteller locators are converted into a shared timeline.
3. **Change check**: tiny gaps are ignored so harmless drift does not cause sync churn.
4. **Leader election**: the bridge picks the most trustworthy current position.
5. **Translation**: if audio and text need to cross formats, the bridge resolves that position through Storyteller transcript data, SMIL, or Whisper alignment.
6. **Propagation**: the resolved position is written back to every applicable client for that mapping.

!!! note "Storyteller, Grimmory, and BookOrbit"
    Storyteller transcript assets improve locator quality, and Grimmory or BookOrbit can act as either the ebook target or the audiobook source for a mapping.
