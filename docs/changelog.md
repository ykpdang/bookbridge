## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added an optional **Bridge Sync** KOReader plugin for pulling bridge-managed books into a device folder.
- Added **Find IDs** helpers for Audiobookshelf and Grimmory library ID settings, with dropdown pickers after lookup.
- Dashboard cards now show recent session stats when that data exists.
- Added an intentional **ABS disabled** mode for ebook-only or maintenance-focused deployments.

### Changed

- The **Whisper Model** setting now accepts custom values instead of only a fixed preset list.
- Forge now uploads EPUB and audio inputs directly to Storyteller through the REST/TUS API instead of depending on a watched library hand-off.
- Added documentation for `STORYTELLER_UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE` so direct-upload chunk size can be tuned when needed.
- Grimmory compatibility and session handling were expanded so newer Grimmory installs behave more reliably as both ebook and audiobook sources.
- Settings now test the values currently in the form and show a restart page after saving.

### Fixed

- Fixed Grimmory session writes so reading and listening sessions stay in the format Grimmory expects.
- Fixed Storyteller direct-upload metadata formatting so Forge no longer fails with `400 Invalid upload-metadata` on Storyteller `web-v2.9.3`.
- Fixed Storyteller direct-upload metadata and readiness issues that could break Forge imports.
- Fixed Grimmory progress, cache, and download edge cases that could break matching or syncing.
- Fixed several sync stability issues around finished-book suggestions, KOReader locators, and replayed instant-sync events.
