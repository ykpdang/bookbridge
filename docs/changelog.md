## [Unreleased]

### What's New

- **KOReader plugin can now update itself.** A new "Check for Plugin Update" option in the Bridge Sync plugin menu lets you check for and install updates directly from KOReader — no manual downloads needed.
- **KOReader stats now shows all reading activity.** The stats page now includes every book KOReader has tracked, not just those linked in BookBridge. Unlinked books appear with an "Unlinked" marker.

### What Changed

- **Storyteller sync now works even when transcript file counts don't match ABS chapters.** Books that were previously rejected due to a mismatch now sync successfully using whatever transcript files are available.

### Fixed

- **Reading progress was being reset to the cover in Scrivener-style EPUBs.** EPUBs where paragraph text is wrapped in `<span>` elements (common in Scrivener exports) would silently lose progress on every sync. This is now fixed.
- **Storyteller sync positioned incorrectly in books with fragment IDs.** Positions are now accurate for these books. (Thanks @Sirozha1337)
- **Storyteller auth could fail when tokens expired mid-session.** Token lifetime is now managed correctly. (Thanks @Sirozha1337)

## [6.4.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- Added an optional **Bridge Sync** KOReader plugin for pulling bridge-managed books into a device folder.
- Added **Find IDs** helpers for Audiobookshelf and Grimmory library ID settings, with dropdown pickers after lookup.
- Added an intentional **ABS disabled** mode for ebook-only or maintenance-focused deployments.
- Added Grimmory shelf and magic shelf support for **Bridge Sync** plugin collection syncing.
- Added a Grimmory shelf picker in Settings to make Bridge Sync collection setup easier.

### Changed

- The **Whisper Model** setting now accepts custom values instead of only a fixed preset list.
- Forge now uploads EPUB and audio inputs directly to Storyteller through the REST/TUS API instead of depending on a watched library hand-off.
- Added documentation for `STORYTELLER_UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE` so direct-upload chunk size can be tuned when needed.
- Grimmory compatibility and session handling were expanded so newer Grimmory installs behave more reliably as both ebook and audiobook sources.
- Settings now test the values currently in the form and show a restart page after saving.
- Dashboard cards now show reading session details.
- Match, Batch Match, Suggestions, and Forge now show clearer working feedback when you start an action.
- Built-in KOSync testing in Settings now works with the values currently in the form.

### Fixed

- Fixed Grimmory session writes so reading and listening sessions stay in the format Grimmory expects.
- Fixed Storyteller direct-upload metadata formatting so Forge no longer fails with `400 Invalid upload-metadata` on Storyteller `web-v2.9.3`.
- Fixed Storyteller direct-upload metadata and readiness issues that could break Forge imports.
- Fixed deadband rollback behavior so tiny audiobook-vs-ebook gaps still avoid leader flapping without pushing older ABS progress back onto newer high-confidence ebook locators.
- Fixed Grimmory progress, cache, and download edge cases that could break matching or syncing.
- Fixed several sync stability issues around finished-book suggestions, KOReader locators, and replayed instant-sync events.
- Fixed Grimmory session reporting so reading and listening sessions are recorded more reliably.
- Fixed dashboard sync warnings so old inactive states do not create misleading out-of-sync messages.
- Fixed the built-in KOSync Test button so it no longer requires saving first.

### Added

- Added a dedicated **Library Suggestions** workspace with background scans, cached repeat scans, and a **Full Refresh** option.
- Added **Grimmory audiobook** support across Match, Batch Match, Suggestions, Forge, and the dashboard.
- Added more flexible linking flows, including ebook-only links, Storyteller-only links, and a **Refresh Grimmory Cache** action in Settings.

### Changed

- Match and dashboard views now show clearer source badges and audio-source details.
- Storyteller transcript ingest now accepts more real-world layouts while staying the preferred timing source when available.

### Fixed

- Fixed cross-format drift cases that could cause bounce-backs or bad resets.
- Fixed ebook-only links getting stuck in processing.
- Fixed edge cases where Storyteller-only links or stale Grimmory data could break matching or syncing.
