# Changelog

For the full history of changes, please refer to the **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cporcellijr/bookbridge/releases)** page.

## [7.0.0]

The headline change is **user accounts**: the bridge now supports more than one reader, each with their own sign-in, their own progress, and their own view of the library. This is a bigger release than usual, so if you are upgrading from an earlier version, please read the short upgrade note below.

### What's New

- **Multiple readers.** You can now create separate accounts for different people — for example, everyone in a household. Each person signs in to their own dashboard, sees only the books they are reading, and keeps their own progress, even when two people are reading the same book.

- **Personal logins for each service.** Every reader enters their own Audiobookshelf, KOSync, Grimmory or BookOrbit, Storyteller, and tracker logins, so each person syncs against their own accounts and their own shelves. The shared engine settings — how often it syncs, library scans, and shelf watching — still live in one place for the main account to manage.

- **A proper sign-in screen.** The dashboard is now protected by a login. The first person to open it sets up the main account, and that account can add more readers from a new Users area in Settings.

### What Changed

- **Upgrading from an earlier version.** After you update and restart, open the dashboard once. Because there are no accounts yet, you will be asked to create your main login — just pick a username and password. As soon as you do, your existing library, your matches, and every service login you had already entered are moved onto that account automatically, so there is nothing to set up again. Your KOReader devices keep syncing exactly as before. From there you can add accounts for other readers whenever you like.

### Fixed

- **CWA progress appears sooner.** Books synced through Calibre-Web-Automated's Kobo sync now show their CWA row on the dashboard right away, instead of only after the first position comes in.

---

## [6.8.0]

The headline additions are a second ebook library manager (BookOrbit) and an optional local-LLM assistant (Ollama), alongside a batch of sync fixes.

### What's New

- **BookOrbit support.** BookOrbit is a newer ebook library manager (with audiobook support) that works just like Grimmory. You can use it instead of Grimmory or alongside it, and pick it as the ebook or audio source when you create a mapping. It also supports an optional "Up Next" collection watch that auto-matches books you drop onto a shelf. See [Configuration → BookOrbit](configuration.md#bookorbit). If you are moving over from Grimmory, a migration script re-points your existing links without rematching.

- **Optional local LLM (Ollama).** If you run a local Ollama server, the bridge can use it to make smarter match suggestions and to rescue audio↔text alignments that plain text matching misses. Everything is off until you turn it on, and every feature falls back to the normal behavior if Ollama is unreachable, so it never blocks a sync. See [Configuration → Ollama](configuration.md#ollama-local-llm-optional).

- **Link Storyteller from any dashboard card.** The "Link" action that ebook-only mappings already had now appears on books with an audio↔ebook match too, so you can attach a Storyteller title to almost any book without rematching it.

- **Combined KOReader reading stats across devices.** If you read the same book on more than one KOReader device, the stats page now adds up the time and pages across them instead of showing each device separately.

- **Expanded stats page.** The stats page has more reading-activity views.

### What Changed

- **Storyteller-led syncs now count as listening time in Audiobookshelf.** When a sync is driven by Storyteller read-along progress, that time is credited back to ABS as listening, so your audiobook stats stay accurate.

### Fixed

- **Database safety on network and virtual filesystems.** On filesystems where SQLite's WAL mode is unreliable (9p, some NFS setups, certain VM shares), the bridge now uses a safer journal mode so the database does not get into a bad state.
- **Storyteller read-along no longer snaps back** in books that use media-overlay (SMIL) fragment IDs for navigation.
- **Fewer false rollbacks from KOReader.** Stale or out-of-order KoSync updates are better guarded against, so a delayed write can't quietly push your position backward.
- **Dashboard "out of sync" warnings** are more accurate for audiobook-vs-ebook comparisons.

## [6.7.0] - 2026-05-11

### What's New

- **Ratings on dashboard cards.** Each book shows StoryGraph and Goodreads ratings as small badges under the cover. They are filled in automatically when a book is linked, and a one-time backfill adds them to books you linked earlier.
- **Sort by rating.** A new **Rating** option in the dashboard sort dropdown orders books by their average rating; books without ratings sort to the bottom.
- **Series grouping.** Books in the same series can be grouped into a single stacked card with combined progress instead of one card each.
- **StoryGraph audiobook editions.** The StoryGraph edition picker now recognizes audiobook formats and shows their duration, so audiobook listeners can pick the right edition.
- **Authoritative ABS matching via Calibre.** If you use the Audiobookshelf calibre plugin, the bridge can read its identifier from Calibre and treat already-mapped books as a sure thing during scans, skipping fuzzy guessing.
- **Bridge Sync can upload your reading stats.** A new "Auto-Sync Reading Stats" option in the KOReader plugin uploads your page stats automatically, with a cooldown so it stays quiet.
- **Forge tuning for Storyteller ReadAloud.** New options to skip the ReadAloud EPUB cache and to tune how long the bridge waits for in-flight Storyteller jobs to recover after a restart.

### Fixed

- **KOReader sync was silently dropping to a less accurate percent-only mode** for many EPUBs with inline formatting. Those positions now resolve correctly, restoring the normal anti-rollback protections.

## [6.6.0] - 2026-05-01

### What's New

- **StoryGraph integration.** StoryGraph joins Hardcover as a reading tracker, with linking, a matching modal, edition picking, and automatic matching.
- **Either-or tracker mode.** Each book can be tracked on Hardcover *or* StoryGraph, one at a time, instead of choosing a single tracker for everything.
- **Calmer KoSync writes.** A new debounce setting groups bursts of KOReader updates together, so rapid page-turns no longer kick off a sync for every single write.

### Fixed

- **A slow service no longer stalls the whole sync cycle.** One unresponsive client used to hold everything up until it timed out; the sync cycle now keeps moving.
- **Steadier StoryGraph and KOReader handling** for edition lookups, renumbered EPUB fragments, and ebook-only matches that previously could lose their link after a rematch.

## [6.5.0] 2026-4-12

### What's New

= **Add CWA reading progress sync via Kobo sync protocol**
Enables bidirectional reading progress sync between the bridge and
Calibre-Web Automated using CWA's Kobo sync endpoints. This allows
stock Kobo e-readers (and KOReader via CWA) to participate in the
sync loop alongside Audiobookshelf, Storyteller, and other clients.
(Thank @dfendr)

- **KOReader plugin can now update itself.** A new "Check for Plugin Update" option appears in the Bridge Sync plugin menu (after Test Connection). It checks whether a newer version of the plugin is available on your bridge server, and if so, offers to download and install it directly from KOReader — no more downloading a ZIP from GitHub and copying it manually.

- **KOReader stats now shows all your reading activity, not just linked books.** The stats page previously only listed books that were linked in BookBridge. It now shows every book KOReader has recorded, whether linked or not. Books that are not linked appear with an "Unlinked" marker so they are easy to tell apart.

### What Changed

- **Storyteller sync no longer rejects books when the transcript file count doesn't match.** If the number of Storyteller transcript files differs from the number of ABS chapters, the bridge previously rejected the book entirely. It now uses whatever transcript files are available and derives timing from them instead. This unblocks sync for books with partial Storyteller transcripts or different chunking than ABS expected.

### Fixed

- **Progress was being silently reset to the cover in Scrivener-style EPUBs.** EPUBs produced by Scrivener — and other tools that wrap every paragraph's text in a `<span>` element — caused the bridge to generate a position reference KOReader could not resolve. KOReader would fall back to position 0 (the cover page) and write that back, erasing saved progress on every sync. The bridge now generates the correct reference for these EPUBs.

- **Storyteller sync placed you at the wrong position in some books.** Fixed a case where Storyteller could not find the right location in books that use fragment IDs for navigation. Sync positions are now accurate for these books. (Thanks @Sirozha1337)

- **Storyteller auth could fail mid-session when tokens expired.** Improved token lifetime management so the bridge no longer hits authentication errors during long Storyteller sync sessions. (Thanks @Sirozha1337)
