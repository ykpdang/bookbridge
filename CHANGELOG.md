# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to BookBridge will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

No unreleased changes yet.

## [7.1.1] - 2026-07-09

The headline is **reader-owned integrations and BookFusion support**: BookBridge now gives each reader a self-service place for their own service accounts, adds BookFusion progress and highlight sync, and expands list/collection bridges without changing the already-released 7.1.0 annotation foundation.

Highlight and note sync still requires the **BridgeSync KOReader plugin from 7.1.0 or newer**. Older BridgeSync builds and plain KOSync clients continue syncing reading position, but they do not have the annotation exchange, sweep, close-capture, or managed collection support.

### What's New

- **BookFusion progress and highlight sync is now wired in.** Readers can link a BookFusion account, sync reading progress by percentage, and relay highlights through the annotation hub using freshly implemented UTF-16 offset/xpointer mapping. BookFusion can be linked by device flow, and the integration forms point manual token setup to BookFusion's Calibre integration page. Uploading books to BookFusion is intentionally out of scope for this release.

- **Readers can now manage their own integrations.** The Account page now links to a self-service Integrations page where each signed-in reader can save their own service usernames, passwords, tokens, keys, and per-user sync toggles without needing admin Settings access. Admins can still manage integrations for any reader from Settings -> Users, and the admin page now points readers to the self-service path.

- **Readest and Hardcover can participate in annotation sync.** Readest cloud highlights and Hardcover annotations can now join the annotation hub using each reader's own account configuration.

- **Hardcover lists can now create KOReader collections.** BridgeSync-managed KOReader manifests can use either Grimmory shelves or Hardcover lists as the collection source. Hardcover collection mapping is per-user, only applies to books already matched in BookBridge, supports all lists or selected list names, and refreshes on a daily cache.

- **Grimmory shelves can now create Hardcover lists.** When enabled for a reader, newly matched Grimmory-backed books are added to Hardcover lists named from their Grimmory shelf membership, mirroring the shelf-to-KOReader-collection flow. The sync is additive only and can use all shelves, magic shelves only, or regular shelves only, with optional list prefixes and excluded shelf names.

### What Changed

- **Integration settings follow the reader.** User-owned credentials live with the reader, either in Account -> My Integrations or in the admin-managed user integrations page. Global Settings keep shared engine behavior such as server URLs, poll intervals, and daemon-level options.

- **KOReader collection settings now live with each reader.** The Grimmory-vs-Hardcover collection source selector now lives per reader under Integrations -> KOReader Collections, matching the per-user manifest behavior and making Hardcover-list collections discoverable even when Grimmory is disabled.

- **Readest uses per-user email/password authentication.** Readest highlight sync now logs in with each reader's own Readest account and caches tokens for that reader, instead of relying on pasted global JWTs.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-07-08

The headline is **a fuller reading-state bridge**: BookBridge now moves highlights, notes, web-reader activity, audiobook progress, and richer freshness metadata together instead of treating sync as only "who has the latest percentage?"

Highlight and note sync requires the **BridgeSync KOReader plugin from this release or newer**. Older BridgeSync builds and plain KOSync clients continue syncing reading position, but they do not have the annotation exchange, sweep, or close-capture support.

### What's New

- **Highlights and notes now have their own sync hub.** KOReader highlights and margin notes can move between devices and the Grimmory and BookOrbit web readers through the updated BridgeSync plugin. Each reader's annotations stay scoped to their own account, deletions travel with the same care as additions, and stable xpointer keys keep one device from erasing another device's highlights just because the same passage was represented slightly differently.

- **BridgeSync grew into a real annotation companion.** The latest KOReader plugin now has explicit **Sync Highlights** and **Sweep All Highlights** actions, captures new annotations when a book closes, scrubs JSON-null note sentinels that could crash KOReader, and uses atomic self-updates so plugin upgrades are less fragile.

- **Every reader can download the KOReader plugin.** The BridgeSync plugin download now appears on each user's Account page, so regular readers do not need admin Settings access to install or update their device plugin.

- **BookOrbit-hosted audiobooks now participate in sync.** Listening progress for BookOrbit audiobooks is read, written, converted across multi-file tracks, and recorded as BookOrbit reading-session activity, so BookOrbit can act as either the ebook side, the audiobook side, or both.

- **Combined audiobook+ebook entries cover ABS ebooks too.** Audiobookshelf ebook progress now participates when a book has both audio and ebook state, instead of being left out once the mapping also included an audiobook.

- **Progress decisions use richer service metadata.** The bridge now persists service-native update timestamps, status, and locator metadata. Leader selection uses that data to suppress stale reappearing states and veto obvious rollback candidates while still allowing genuine rereads or forward movement.

- **KOSync document linking lives in Add / Update Book.** Readers can now review recent unlinked KOSync document hashes, connect them to one of their books, copy the hash, unlink it, or delete stale entries from the same place they already match and repair book links.

- **AI features can use OpenAI or any OpenAI-compatible server.** The optional LLM layer (smarter match suggestions and audio-text alignment rescue) is no longer Ollama-only - point it at OpenAI or a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as llama-server or llama-swap via the new provider selector in Settings. Existing Ollama setups keep working unchanged, and every feature still falls back to normal behavior when the provider is unreachable.

### What Changed

- **Annotation sync is source-aware and account-aware.** BookOrbit ownership is guarded before web-reader annotations are relayed, Grimmory web notes use their own sub-spoke so notes survive round trips, and lossy spoke pulls no longer rewrite identity keys.

- **Storyteller sync understands the newer API shape.** BookBridge now talks to Storyteller's current v2 token and position endpoints while keeping a legacy fallback, and the poller notices meaningful locator changes even when the rounded percentage has not changed.

- **Alignment lookups are faster on repeat syncs.** Parsed alignment maps are cached and refreshed when a map is rebuilt, which avoids repeatedly reparsing large books during the same sync cycle.

- **Add / Update Book clears after queueing.** The search box now empties when you add a book to the queue, so you can go straight into your next search.

- **Settings point users to the right place.** Grimmory highlight sync is configured in each reader's Integrations, matching the per-user credential model introduced in 7.0.0. The admin integrations view also gives clearer KOReader and BookOrbit setup notes.

### Fixed

- **Audiobookshelf listeners recover on their own.** A dropped Audiobookshelf Socket.IO connection now revives itself instead of quietly going silent until the next restart.

- **Same-folder suggestions are stricter.** Split-root libraries no longer create misleading same-folder suggestions when the folder context is not actually the same book, and selected source paths stay anchored so duplicate-looking filenames do not drift to the wrong file.

- **Connection tests live where the credentials do.** The test buttons on the general settings gave inconsistent results because logins are now per-reader; they have been removed, and each reader tests connections from their own Integrations page.

- **BridgeSync self-updates find the plugin metadata reliably.** The updater now locates `_meta.lua` instead of assuming a specific zip layout.

## [7.0.0]

The headline change is **user accounts**: the bridge now supports more than one reader, each with their own sign-in, their own progress, and their own view of the library. This is a bigger release than usual — if you are upgrading from an earlier version, please read the upgrade note below.

### What's New

- **Multiple readers.** You can now create separate accounts for different people — for example, everyone in a household. Each person signs in to their own dashboard, sees only the books they are reading, and keeps their own progress, even when two people are reading the same book.

- **Separate logins for each reader.** The main account gives each reader their own Audiobookshelf, KOSync, Grimmory or BookOrbit, Storyteller, and tracker logins, so everyone syncs against their own accounts and their own shelves. The shared engine settings — how often it syncs, library scans, and shelf watching — still live in one place for the main account to manage.

- **A proper sign-in screen.** The dashboard is now protected by a login. The first person to open it sets up the main account, and that account can add more readers from a new Users area in Settings.

- **A streamlined Add Book screen.** Searching your libraries, queueing up several books at once, and matching or forging the whole queue now happen in one place.

- **Same-folder matching.** When an audiobook and an ebook live in the same library folder, the Suggestions page now flags them as a likely pair before any fuzzy or AI scoring — and treats them as an exact match only when the titles also agree, so two unrelated books sharing a folder aren't matched by mistake.

- **Review suggestions in bulk.** Tick several suggestions and add them to the queue at once, or add every exact (100%) match in one click with **Add all exact**. Adding to the queue no longer reloads the page, so you keep your place in a long list — and you can run **Forge & Match All** right from the Suggestions page.

- **Hardcover and StoryGraph, independently.** You can now enable both trackers at the same time, each with its own toggle, instead of having to choose one or the other.

- **Install the KOReader plugin from Settings.** Download the BridgeSync plugin straight from the KOSync settings section — no need to fetch it from GitHub Releases.

### What Changed

- **Upgrading from an earlier version.** After you update and restart, open the dashboard once. Because there are no accounts yet, you will be asked to create your main login — just pick a username and password. As soon as you do, your existing library, your matches, and every service login you had already entered are moved onto that account automatically, so there is nothing to set up again. Your KOReader devices keep syncing exactly as before. From there you can add accounts for other readers whenever you like.

- **The project is now called BookBridge.** This is a name and branding change only — your settings, mappings, KOReader devices, and the way syncing works are all unaffected.

- **Matching returns to the dashboard right away.** Single and batch matches now hand the slower work (tracker lookups, forging) to the background, so the screen comes back immediately and books appear as each one finishes.

### Fixed

- **CWA progress appears sooner.** Books synced through Calibre-Web-Automated's Kobo sync now show their CWA row on the dashboard right away, instead of only after the first position comes in.

- **More accurate Hardcover/StoryGraph matching.** Auto-matching now prefers the book's own ISBN, no longer grabs a wrong book that merely shares a title, and works for ebook-only books.

- **Forge & Match survives a restart.** If the bridge restarts while a Forge & Match is still processing, it now picks the job back up and finishes it instead of leaving the book stuck.

- **Storyteller forged books are no longer hidden.** Storyteller collections the bridge creates are now public, so the books it adds show up as expected.

- **KOReader syncs reliably on wake.** The BridgeSync plugin now syncs dependably when a device wakes from sleep.

- **Manual and forged KOReader links stay put.** Hash links you set by hand, or that come from forging, now persist across syncs.

- **Large Grimmory libraries scan fully.** Library scans now page through big Grimmory libraries (with configurable timeouts) instead of stopping short.

### Security

- **Hardened the web app for logins.** Session-based actions are now protected against cross-site request forgery, and the KOSync login endpoints no longer reveal the sync key.

## [6.8.0]

### What's New

- **Link Storyteller from any dashboard card.** The "Link" action that ebook-only mappings already had is now available on books with an audio↔ebook match too: the Storyteller row appears on every card when the integration is enabled, and any book without a linked Storyteller UUID gets the clickable Link affordance (opens the same search modal). Linking an audiobook-mode book downloads the Storyteller artifact, preserves the original ebook filename, ingests Storyteller transcripts with ABS chapters, and queues the book for reprocessing — exactly as match-based linking already did.

- **LLM match rescue for Grimmory and BookOrbit.** When filename/title matching fails to link an ebook to a Grimmory or BookOrbit library entry, the bridge now shortlists the cached library by fuzzy similarity and asks the Ollama judge to confirm the one true book (Settings → Ollama → "Library match rescue", `OLLAMA_LIBRARY_MATCH`, on by default). Hot sync/poll paths never pay LLM latency — the rescue only runs on linking paths — and verdicts are memoized until the next library refresh.

- **Semantic position rescue for ebook text lookups.** When KoSync/Storyteller position lookups can't fuzzy-match a phrase in the EPUB (paraphrased narration, transcription noise), the bridge can now locate the position by embedding similarity over the hint neighborhood, then refine to a character offset (`OLLAMA_EBOOK_TEXT_FALLBACK`, on by default, threshold shared with the alignment fallback).

- **Persistent embedding cache.** Suggestion scans no longer re-embed the whole library's titles every scan: embeddings are cached in a new `embedding_cache` table keyed by model + text hash (Alembic migration included). Rows for other models and rows older than 90 days are pruned automatically.

- **Structured outputs for the Ollama judge.** Judge calls now send a JSON schema (Ollama ≥ 0.5) so verdicts always come back with the right keys and types — older Ollama servers automatically fall back to plain JSON mode.

- **Ollama performance and reliability options.** New settings: **Keep Alive** (`OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE`, default 5m) controls how long models stay loaded between requests, and **Chat Context Length** (`OLLAMA_NUM_CTX`) overrides the judge's context window. Judge generation is now capped (`num_predict`) so a confused model can't stream until the timeout, and transient connection blips are retried once instead of aborting a whole scan's re-ranking.

- **Richer judge prompts.** Hardcover/StoryGraph match verification now includes series, release year, and the audiobook's ISBN/ASIN in the judge prompt when available, improving disambiguation of sequels and editions.

- **Ollama Test button reports model details.** The settings Test button now queries `/api/show` and displays each model's context length and capabilities, and warns when the configured embedding model doesn't report embedding capability.

### Fixed

- **Silent embedding truncation in alignment anchor rescue.** For long books, alignment windows could exceed the embedding model's token limit and Ollama silently truncated them at an unknown point. Windows are now embedded as a bounded prefix (4,000 chars) so anchors stay reliable on big books.

## [6.7.0] - 2026-05-11

### What's New

- **Book ratings now appear on dashboard cards.** Each card shows StoryGraph and Goodreads ratings as small badges under the cover, with tooltips that include the rating, review count, and source. Both ratings are captured automatically when a book is linked — Goodreads via the cached Grimmory metadata, StoryGraph via a one-time scrape of the book's community-reviews page. A one-time backfill runs in the background at startup so books linked before this release also get their StoryGraph ratings filled in (self-limiting; no settings toggle needed).

- **Sort by rating.** A new **Rating** option in the dashboard sort dropdown sorts books by the average of their StoryGraph and Goodreads ratings (using whichever is available when only one is present). Books without ratings always sort to the bottom regardless of direction.

- **Series grouping on the dashboard.** Books that are part of the same series can now be grouped into a single stacked card with combined progress and metadata, instead of showing each entry separately. A new Alembic migration adds the supporting series-metadata columns and existing series entries are populated automatically.

- **StoryGraph supports audio editions and shows audio duration.** The StoryGraph edition picker now detects audiobook, digital audiobook, audio CD, and narrated print/audio formats and displays duration alongside other edition metadata, so audiobook listeners can pick the correct StoryGraph edition.

- **Authoritative ABS identifier mapping via Calibre.** When the [Audiobookshelf-calibre-plugin](https://github.com/jbhul/Audiobookshelf-calibre-plugin) is in use, the bridge can read its `audiobookshelf_id` identifier from Calibre's `metadata.db` (or the CWA `/ajax/book/{id}` endpoint as fallback) and treat it as authoritative during suggestion scans — bypassing fuzzy title/author matching for already-mapped books. Configurable in Settings → CWA → Authoritative ABS Identifier Mapping.

- **Bridge Sync plugin can auto-upload KOReader reading stats.** A new "Auto-Sync Reading Stats" toggle (on by default) uploads KOReader's `statistics.sqlite` page-stat rows alongside the plugin's existing auto-syncs (wake, network reconnect, Sync Now), with a 5-minute cooldown between uploads so it stays quiet on the device.

- **Forge tuning for Storyteller ReadAloud workflows.** Three new settings appear in Settings → Storyteller / Forge:
  - **Skip ReadAloud EPUB Cache** (`STORYTELLER_NO_EPUB_CACHE`) — make Forge use the original EPUB for text extraction instead of downloading and caching Storyteller's ReadAloud EPUB. Useful when the original EPUB is on a mapped library volume.
  - **Forge Recovery Max Wait** (`STORYTELLER_RECOVERY_MAX_WAIT_MINUTES`, default 360) and **Forge Recovery Poll Interval** (`STORYTELLER_RECOVERY_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, default 2) — tune how long the bridge waits for in-flight Storyteller jobs to recover after restart before giving up.

### What Changed

- **Grimmory library scans are skipped when Grimmory is not configured.** Previously, library refresh paths could attempt a Grimmory scan even with no credentials configured, generating noisy error logs. The bridge now short-circuits cleanly when Grimmory is disabled.

### Fixed

- **KOReader sync was silently demoted to percent-fallback for many EPUBs with inline span markup.** KOReader emits XPaths in the form `/text()[N].MMM` whenever a paragraph contains inline children that split text into multiple nodes. The XPath resolver's offset-stripping regex only matched the unbracketed `/text().NNN` form, leaving the `.MMM` glued onto the path and causing `lxml` to reject it as invalid. The resolver fell back to percent-based normalization, bypassing single-client-delta and deadband-rollback protections in the sync manager. Both bracketed and unbracketed forms now parse correctly.

---

## [6.6.0] - 2026-05-01

### What's New

- **StoryGraph integration (alongside Hardcover).** The bridge now supports StoryGraph as a tracker target with linking, modal-based matching, edition picking, automatch, and either-or progress sync. A new `storygraph_details` table stores the link and matching metadata.
- **Either-or tracker mode.** Books can be tracked on either Hardcover *or* StoryGraph (one at a time per book) instead of having to pick a single tracker globally.
- **KoSync PUT debounce.** A new `KOSYNC_PUT_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` setting coalesces bursts of KoSync writes so rapid page-turns no longer trigger a sync cycle per write.

### Fixed

- **Hangs during parallel state fetch.** `_fetch_states_parallel` now uses `concurrent.futures.wait()` instead of `as_completed()` so a single slow client no longer blocks the whole sync cycle until timeout.
- **StoryGraph edition and URL handling** has been hardened for edge cases discovered during the integration rollout.
- **KOReader DocFragment spine drift** is now handled gracefully when fragments are renumbered between updates.
- **ABS IDs are preserved for ebook-only matches** so manual matches don't lose their link after rematch.
- **LXML position fallback for XPath resolution** improves locator accuracy when the canonical XPath cannot be resolved exactly.

---

## [6.5.0] 2026-4-12

### What's New

= **Add CWA reading progress sync via Kobo sync protocol**
Enables bidirectional reading progress sync between the bridge and
Calibre-Web Automated using CWA's Kobo sync endpoints. This allows
stock Kobo e-readers (and KOReader via CWA) to participate in the
sync loop alongside Audiobookshelf, Storyteller, and other clients.

- **KOReader plugin can now update itself.** A new "Check for Plugin Update" option appears in the Bridge Sync plugin menu (after Test Connection). It checks whether a newer version of the plugin is available on your bridge server, and if so, offers to download and install it directly from KOReader — no more downloading a ZIP from GitHub and copying it manually.

- **KOReader stats now shows all your reading activity, not just linked books.** The stats page previously only listed books that were linked in BookBridge. It now shows every book KOReader has recorded, whether linked or not. Books that are not linked appear with an "Unlinked" marker so they are easy to tell apart.

### What Changed

- **Storyteller sync no longer rejects books when the transcript file count doesn't match.** If the number of Storyteller transcript files differs from the number of ABS chapters, the bridge previously rejected the book entirely. It now uses whatever transcript files are available and derives timing from them instead. This unblocks sync for books with partial Storyteller transcripts or different chunking than ABS expected.

### Fixed

- **Progress was being silently reset to the cover in Scrivener-style EPUBs.** EPUBs produced by Scrivener — and other tools that wrap every paragraph's text in a `<span>` element — caused the bridge to generate a position reference KOReader could not resolve. KOReader would fall back to position 0 (the cover page) and write that back, erasing saved progress on every sync. The bridge now generates the correct reference for these EPUBs.

- **Storyteller sync placed you at the wrong position in some books.** Fixed a case where Storyteller could not find the right location in books that use fragment IDs for navigation. Sync positions are now accurate for these books. (Thanks @Sirozha1337)

- **Storyteller auth could fail mid-session when tokens expired.** Improved token lifetime management so the bridge no longer hits authentication errors during long Storyteller sync sessions. (Thanks @Sirozha1337)

---

## [6.4.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Fixed a manual Forge regression where Grimmory EPUB selections could be sent with the display label `Grimmory` instead of the internal `Booklore` source key, causing `Unknown text source: 'Grimmory'` failures.
- Improved Storyteller transcript-ingest diagnostics so title-directory misses now log the resolved `STORYTELLER_ASSETS_DIR/assets` search root, candidate titles, and a short sample of available asset directories before falling back to SMIL or Whisper.

## [6.4.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- Added an optional **Bridge Sync** KOReader plugin for pulling bridge-managed books onto a device-managed folder.
- Added **Find IDs** helpers for Audiobookshelf and Grimmory library ID fields in Settings, including quick pick dropdowns.
- Added an **Audiobookshelf disabled mode** by treating `disabled` as an intentional off switch for ABS URL or token settings.
- Added Grimmory shelf and magic shelf support for **Bridge Sync** plugin collection syncing.
- Added a Grimmory shelf picker in Settings to make Bridge Sync collection setup easier.

### Changed

- The **Whisper Model** field in Settings now accepts custom values instead of only the built-in preset list.
- The **Bridge Sync** KOReader plugin now keeps its settings submenu open while you make multiple configuration changes, and the **Managed Folder** setting now uses a folder picker instead of manual path entry.
- Storyteller Forge now uploads staged EPUB and audio files directly to Storyteller over the REST/TUS API instead of relying on watched-library folder hand-offs.
- Storyteller direct-upload settings now expose `STORYTELLER_UPLOAD_CHUNK_SIZE` for tuning TUS PATCH chunk size when needed.
- Grimmory compatibility was broadened across search, cache refresh, downloads, and progress/session handling so newer Grimmory installs work more reliably as both ebook and audiobook sources.
- Settings now test the values currently typed into the form, and saving settings shows a restart-wait page until the application is healthy again.
- Dashboard cards now show reading session details.
- Match, Batch Match, Suggestions, and Forge now show clearer working feedback when you start an action.
- Built-in KOSync testing in Settings now works with the values currently in the form.

### Fixed

- Fixed Grimmory session writes so reading and listening sessions stay in the strict format Grimmory expects.
- Fixed Storyteller TUS `Upload-Metadata` formatting for direct Forge uploads. Metadata pairs are now serialized without post-comma whitespace, which restores compatibility with Storyteller `web-v2.9.3` and prevents `400 Invalid upload-metadata` failures during Auto-Forge and manual Forge.
- Fixed Storyteller direct-upload and post-import issues, including `Upload-Metadata` formatting, import readiness timing, duplicate Forge triggers, and several incorrect locator/progress writes.
- Fixed Grimmory progress writes, single-file audiobook Forge downloads, cache hydration edge cases, and truncated downloads that could break matching or syncing.
- Fixed suggestions and sync edge cases around finished books, instant-sync replays, sentence-level KOReader locators, and cross-format rollback handling.
- Fixed deadband rollback behavior so tiny audiobook-vs-ebook gaps still avoid leader flapping without pushing older ABS progress back onto newer high-confidence ebook locators.
- Fixed Grimmory session reporting so reading and listening sessions are recorded more reliably.
- Fixed dashboard sync warnings so old inactive states do not create misleading out-of-sync messages.
- Fixed the built-in KOSync Test button so it no longer requires saving first.

---

## [6.3.3] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- Added a dedicated **Library Suggestions** page for scanning unmatched titles, reviewing likely audiobook and ebook pairs, and queueing approved matches in bulk.
- Added support for using **Grimmory audiobooks** as the audio side of a sync, including matching, batch processing, suggestions, Forge, and dashboard tracking.
- Added more flexible linking flows, including **ebook-only links**, **Storyteller-only links**, and a one-click **Refresh Grimmory Cache** action in Settings.

### Changed

- Suggestions scans now run in the background with progress updates, cached repeat scans, and a **Full Refresh** option for rescanning the whole unmatched library.
- Match, Batch Match, Suggestions, and the dashboard now show clearer source badges and audio-source details so it is easier to tell where each book came from.
- Storyteller transcript import is more forgiving of real-world file layouts and continues to prefer Storyteller timing data before falling back to SMIL or Whisper.

### Fixed

- Fixed cases where small cross-format differences could cause progress bounce-backs or an incorrect reset when switching between audiobook and ebook apps.
- Fixed ebook-only links getting stuck in processing by skipping audiobook preparation work they do not need.
- Fixed edge cases where Storyteller-only links or stale Grimmory data could break matching, hashing, or syncing until the book was refreshed.

---

## [6.3.2] - 2026-02-27

### Enhancements

- **Test Connection Buttons**: Added diagnostic "Test" buttons to every service section in Settings (ABS, KOSync, Storyteller, Grimmory, CWA, Hardcover, Telegram). Each button performs a live connectivity check and returns specific error messages — distinguishing wrong URL, wrong credentials, DNS failure, timeout, and disabled/unconfigured states.
- **Instant Sync Toggle**: Added `INSTANT_SYNC_ENABLED` setting to enable or disable event-driven instant sync globally. When off, the ABS Socket.IO listener and KoSync push trigger are both inactive and the bridge falls back to the standard background poll cycle.
- **Instant Sync Settings**: Added `ABS_SOCKET_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` (default 30s) to control how long the socket listener waits after a playback event before triggering a sync. Tune this lower for faster response or higher to avoid hammering downstream services during active scrubbing.
- **Per-Client Polling**: Storyteller and Grimmory can now be configured with their own poll intervals, independent of the global sync cycle. Set either client to `custom` mode in Settings and choose a polling interval (in seconds). The poller checks for position changes on active books only and triggers a targeted sync when a real change is detected.
- **Shared Write Suppression**: Centralized write-tracking into a single `write_tracker` module. All clients (ABS, KoSync, Storyteller, Grimmory) now share the same suppression logic to prevent feedback loops after the bridge pushes a progress update.
- **Storyteller Transcript Priority Source**: Added Storyteller forced-alignment transcript ingestion as the top transcript source during matching/linking (priority: Storyteller -> SMIL -> Whisper).
- **New Optional Setting `STORYTELLER_ASSETS_DIR`**: Added Settings/UI support for Storyteller assets root (`{root}/assets/{title}/transcriptions`). This source is opt-in and skipped when unset.
- **Native Storyteller Alignment Maps**: Added direct map generation from `wordTimeline` data (`chapter`, local UTF-16 char, local ts, global ts) without anchor rebuild.
- **Direct Timestamp -> EPUB Locator (Storyteller only)**: ABS audiobook timestamps on Storyteller-transcript books can now resolve to EPUB locators directly from transcript offsets, bypassing fuzzy text search.
- **Storyteller Backfill Action**: Added a Settings maintenance action to bulk ingest/re-ingest Storyteller transcripts for existing Storyteller-linked books and rebuild storyteller-native alignments.
- **Storyteller Transcript Ingest in Forge Pipeline**: Added transcript ingestion and anchored alignment generation directly in the forge workflow.
- **Suggestion Discovery from Socket Events**: Unknown-book Socket.IO progress events now trigger suggestion discovery to surface likely matches automatically.
- **Event-Driven Real-Time Sync**: Added ABS Socket.IO listener for near-instant sync. When you play/pause an audiobook in Audiobookshelf, progress automatically syncs to all configured clients (KoSync, Storyteller, Grimmory, Hardcover) within ~30 seconds — no more waiting for the poll cycle. Also triggers instant sync on KoSync PUT from KOReader. Configurable via `ABS_SOCKET_ENABLED` and `ABS_SOCKET_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`.
- **Dashboard Search**: Added instant client-side search filter to the dashboard. Users can now type in a "Search books..." field to filter the library by title or author in real time without a page reload.
- **Sync Now & Mark Complete Actions**: Added quick-action buttons to each book card — ⚡ triggers an immediate background sync cycle, and ✅ marks a book as finished across all configured platforms with an optional mapping cleanup prompt.
- **Dashboard Version Badge**: Cleaned up the version display badge. Dev builds now show `Build dev-N` and official releases show `vX.Y.Z` without redundant prefixes.

### Bug Fixes

- **Settings Save Not Restarting**: Fixed a critical bug where saving settings from the UI did not actually restart the application. The restart function called `sys.exit(0)` from a background thread, which in Python only raises `SystemExit` in that thread — the main process kept running with stale configuration. All service singletons (Grimmory, Storyteller, ABS socket, etc.) retained their old URLs, credentials, and settings until the container was fully rebuilt. Replaced with `os.kill(SIGTERM)` to properly signal the main process.
- **Grimmory Refresh Retry Storm**: Fixed an infinite retry loop when Grimmory is slow or unreachable. Failed cache refreshes left the cache timestamp at zero, causing every subsequent sync cycle to immediately retry the full library scan — spiking CPU and flooding logs. Added a 5-minute cooldown after failed refreshes that suppresses retries while preserving normal cache TTL behavior on the happy path.
- **ABS Socket.IO Auth Reliability**: The socket connection was previously sending the auth token at the transport level (HTTP headers + Socket.IO CONNECT packet) in addition to the `"auth"` event. On some ABS setups this caused both the primary token and the fallback to be rejected immediately. Auth is now sent exclusively via the `"auth"` event (the canonical ABS flow). If authentication fails, the listener disconnects cleanly and the bridge automatically falls back to the standard poll cycle — sync continues uninterrupted.
- **Storyteller Filename Prefix Compatibility**: Ingestion now accepts both `00000-xxxxx.json` and `00001-xxxxx.json` chapter prefixes.
- **Storyteller Format Guardrails**: Backfill/ingest now validates chapter JSON shape (`dict` with `wordTimeline`) before ingesting, preventing invalid files from failing alignment after copy.
- **ABS Sync Lag with Storyteller Transcripts**: Fixed delayed ABS synchronization behavior for Storyteller-transcript-backed books.
- **Tri-Link Drift and Storyteller Jump Detection**: Corrected drift handling and jump-detection logic to prevent incorrect position propagation.
- **Storyteller Backfill and Grimmory Reset Fallback**: Fixed backfill messaging/flow and Grimmory clear/reset fallback behavior.
- **KOSync Hash Mismatch**: Resolved a hash mismatch issue that occurred when the device epub differs from the bridge epub, preventing stale progress lookups.
- **KOSync Shadow Documents**: Fixed an issue where stale shadow documents could be returned in GET progress responses, causing incorrect sync positions.
- **KOSync Admin Endpoints**: Corrected auth handling on admin endpoints to allow dashboard access while keeping sensitive operations protected.
- **Grimmory Double Search**: Fixed a redundant double-search issue in Grimmory book lookups, improving match performance.
- **Database Schema**: Consolidated schema repair into a single clean Alembic migration, reducing startup migration time and preventing edge-case schema conflicts.
- **Mark Complete Crash**: Fixed a `TypeError` in the `mark_complete` endpoint caused by invalid `LocatorResult` keyword arguments.
- **LRUCache Thread Safety**: Added `threading.Lock` to the `LRUCache` class in `ebook_utils.py`. The cache is accessed concurrently by the sync daemon, forge background jobs, and web server requests, but `OrderedDict.move_to_end()` and `popitem()` are not thread-safe for concurrent mutation.
- **Forge Service Audio Copying**: Fixed an indentation error in the audio file copying logic that prevented files from being copied when found via exact path or suffix matching.
- **ABS Socket.IO Feedback Loop**: Fixed a self-triggering sync loop where BookBridge's own ABS progress writes fired a `user_item_progress_updated` socket event, which the listener then treated as a real user change and scheduled another sync cycle. A module-level write-suppression tracker now stamps each book after a write; any socket event arriving within 60 seconds of that stamp is silently dropped. A single real progress change now produces exactly one sync cycle instead of three.
- **Grimmory Full Library Scan on Progress Update**: Fixed `update_progress()` calling `_refresh_book_cache()` after every successful write, which fetched all books from the Grimmory API on every sync cycle. Progress is now applied to the cached entry in-place. Full library scans still occur on initial load and the hourly staleness check.

### Maintenance

- **Comment Cleanup**: Removed reflective/speculative inline comments for clearer, more maintainable code.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-02-23

### � Critical Update Requirements

- **Storyteller API v2 Requirement:** The bridge has fully transitioned to the Storyteller REST API v2 endpoints (`/api/v2/`). **You MUST update your Storyteller container to the latest version to use Bridge v6.3.0.** Legacy Storyteller versions are no longer supported and will result in 404 connection errors.
- **Docker Compose Volume Mounts for "Forge":** The new Auto-Forge pipeline requires the local content paths it reads from, such as `BOOKS_DIR` and any optional transcript/local-fallback mounts, to be mapped correctly in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Database Migration:** This update includes a major database schema upgrade (Alembic) to support the Tri-Link architecture. **Highly Recommended: Backup your `database.db` and legacy JSON files before pulling this update.** If you encounter a boot-loop due to a locked database, simply deleting the DB and letting it rebuild is the fastest fix, as the bridge can auto-match most entries automatically.
- **KOSync "Stuck" Progress on Old Links:** Books matched under older versions of the bridge might lack the `original_ebook_filename` required by the new Tri-Link architecture. If an older book stops syncing progress to KOReader after this update, simply delete the mapping from the dashboard and re-match it to rebuild the link correctly.

### �🚀 New Features & Integrations

- **Tri-Link Architecture**: Maintain a three-way link between ABS audiobook, KOReader ebook, and Storyteller entries.
- **Auto-Forge Pipeline**: Automated downloading, staging, and upload to Storyteller for processing.
- **Hardcover.app Audiobook Support**: Link specific editions and sync listening progress (in seconds).
- **Grimmory & CWA (OPDS) Integration**: Fetch ebooks from Grimmory and OPDS sources, including backward-compatible fallbacks for Grimmory v2.
- **Split-Port Security Mode**: Run sync and admin UI on separate ports.
- **New Transcription Providers**: Support for Whisper.cpp Server, Deepgram API, and CUDA GPU acceleration.
- **Advanced Anchor Mapping**: Implemented BS4-to-LXML Hybrid Anchor Mapping and SMIL Extractor Smart Duration Mapping for perfect KOReader xpath generation.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **UI Redesign**: Horizontal dashboard cards, overhauled match pages, and responsive settings UI.
- **Progress Suggestions**: Smart auto-discovery and suggestions for potential matches.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: ABSClient web UI settings now take effect dynamically without requiring a restart.
- **Optimized Workflows**: Restored automatic addition of collections and shelves post Auto-Forge processing.
- **Logging Standardization**: Consistent emoji prefixes and log levels across the entire codebase.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **KOReader Sync**: Fixed KOReader sync crashes caused by an XPath double `body` tag issue.
- **KOSync Sync Integrity**: Prevented destructive progress pushes, preserved manual hash overrides, and fixed KOSync hash overwrites by Storyteller artifacts.
- **Storyteller Stability**: Fixed race conditions in Storyteller ingestion and removed conflicting Storyteller fallback collection logic.
- **System Stability**: Fixed special characters in filenames breaking glob searches, corrected Grimmory shelf assignment issues during batch matching, and resolved legacy KOSync client headers, legacy exception types, and sync position payloads.
- **Database Persistence & Migrations**: Forced absolute paths for SQLite connections to prevent ephemeral Docker data loss, auto-upgraded legacy DB-migrated books, and prevented legacy DB crashes on startup via Alembic stamping.
- **XPath Hardening**: Defaulted Crengine-safe XPath suffixes, and hardened generation against fragile inline tags to prevent parsing drift.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes & Deprecations

- **Unified DB Architecture**: Transitioned to SQLAlchemy for alignments, transcripts, and settings.
- **Alembic Migrations**: Improved migration tracking and safety checks.
- **Storyteller API**: Removed direct DB access in favor of strictly API-based communication; legacy Storyteller DB fallback has been deprecated.

**Breaking Change:** Storyteller sync now uses the REST API instead of direct SQLite writes. This prevents the mobile app from overwriting synced positions.

#### Added

- **Storyteller REST API client** (`storyteller_api.py`)
  - Authenticates via `/api/token` endpoint
  - Updates positions via `/api/books/{uuid}/positions`
  - Auto-refreshes tokens (30-second expiry)
  - Falls back to SQLite if API credentials not configured
  
- **New environment variables:**
  - `STORYTELLER_API_URL` - Storyteller server URL (e.g., `http://host.docker.internal:8001`)
  - `STORYTELLER_USER` - Storyteller username
  - `STORYTELLER_PASSWORD` - Storyteller password

#### Changed

- `main.py` now imports from `storyteller_api` with SQLite fallback
- Dockerfile updated to include `storyteller_api.py`
- Startup logs now indicate which Storyteller mode is active (API vs SQLite)

#### Fixed

- **Mobile app overwrite issue** - Storyteller mobile app's 8-second sync cycle can no longer overwrite positions set by the sync daemon
- Uses timestamp leapfrog strategy for conflict resolution
